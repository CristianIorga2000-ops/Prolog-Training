%LAB 3 EXERCISE 3 SUBPOINT A
%Write a predicate to determine the sum of two numbers written in list representation

%SUMMARY
%The addition of the two numbers represented as lists is done by:
%	1) reversing the lists
%	2) summing the elements of the two lists (by position) into a third list
%	3) processing the third list so that any element greater than 10 (with previous
%		remainder) is recalculated to be modulo 10 and then 1 is added to the next
%		element
